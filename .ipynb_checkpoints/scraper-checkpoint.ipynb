    "Welcome to the homework on web scraping. While many people might view working with data (including scraping, parsing, storing, etc.) a necessary evil to get to the \"fun\" stuff (i.e. modeling), I think that if presented in the right way this munging can be quite empowering. Imagine you never had to worry or ask those _what if_ questions about data existing or being accessible... but that you can get it yourself!\n",

What do you see? A photo of a close friend’s child. An automatically generated slide show commemorating six years of friendship between two acquaintances. An eerily on-target ad for something you’ve been meaning to buy. A funny video. A sad video. A recently live video. Lots of video; more video than you remember from before. A somewhat less-on-target ad. Someone you saw yesterday feeling blessed. Someone you haven’t seen in 10 years feeling worried.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"734\" data-total-count=\"1219\">And then: A family member who loves politics asking, “Is this really who we want to be president?” A co-worker, whom you’ve never heard talk about politics, asking the same about a different candidate. A story about Donald Trump that “just can’t be true” in a figurative sense. A story about Donald Trump that “just can’t be true” in a literal sense. A video of Bernie Sanders speaking, overlaid with text, shared from a source you’ve never seen before, viewed 15 million times. An article questioning Hillary Clinton’s honesty; a headline questioning Donald Trump’s sanity. A few shares that go a bit too far: headlines you would never pass along yourself but that you might tap, read and probably not forget.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"637\" data-total-count=\"1856\">Maybe you’ve noticed your feed becoming bluer; maybe you’ve felt it becoming redder. Either way, in the last year, it has almost certainly become more intense. You’ve seen a lot of media sources you don’t recognize and a lot of posts bearing no memorable brand at all. You’ve seen politicians and celebrities and corporations weigh in directly; you’ve probably seen posts from the candidates themselves. You’ve seen people you’re close to and people you’re not, with increasing levels of urgency, declare it is now time to speak up, to take a stand, to set aside allegiances or hangups or political correctness or hate.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"622\" data-total-count=\"2478\">Facebook, in the years leading up to this election, hasn’t just become nearly ubiquitous among American internet users; it has centralized online news consumption in an unprecedented way. According to the company, its site is used by more than 200 million people in the United States each month, out of a total population of 320 million. A 2016 Pew study found that <a href=\"http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/\">44 percent of Americans</a> read or watch news on Facebook. These are approximate exterior dimensions and can tell us only so much. But we can know, based on these facts alone, that Facebook is hosting a huge portion of the political conversation in America.</p>        <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-1\">Continue reading the main story</a>\\n    </div><!-- close story-body -->\\n    <div class=\"supplemental first\" id=\"supplemental-1\">\\n    </div><!-- close supplemental -->\\n</div><!-- close story-body-supplemental -->\\n<div class=\"story-interrupter\" id=\"story-continues-1\">\\n    <div id=\"FlexAd\" class=\"ad flex-ad nocontent robots-nocontent\">\\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\\n</div>\\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-2\">Continue reading the main story</a>\\n    <div class=\"flex-ad-creative\"></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"story-body-supplemental\">\\n    <div class=\"story-body story-body-2\">\\n        <script>\\n\\tif (window.magnum && window.magnum.responsiveImages && window.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage) {\\n\\t\\twindow.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage(\\'100000004602749\\',\\'vertical-full-bleed\\',790,600,2.0663404023926,6.0171919770774,2.5013594344753,5.945558739255,\\'#FFFFFF\\');\\n\\t}\\n</script>\\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"906\" data-total-count=\"3384\" id=\"story-continues-2\">The Facebook product, to users in 2016, is familiar yet subtly expansive. Its algorithms have their pick of text, photos and video produced and posted by established media organizations large and small, local and national, openly partisan or nominally unbiased. But there’s also a new and distinctive sort of operation that has become hard to miss: political news and advocacy pages made specifically for Facebook, uniquely positioned and cleverly engineered to reach audiences exclusively in the context of the news feed. These are news sources that essentially do not exist outside of Facebook, and you’ve probably never heard of them. They have names like Occupy Democrats; The Angry Patriot; US Chronicle; Addicting Info; RightAlerts; Being Liberal; Opposing Views; Fed-Up Americans; American News; and hundreds more. Some of these pages have millions of followers; many have hundreds of thousands.</p><div class=\"newsletter-signup variant-1-hidden \" id=\"newsletter-promo\" data-newsletter-productCode=\"MA\" data-newsletter-productTitle=\"The New York Times Magazine\" aria-labeledby=\"newsletter-promo-heading\">\\n    <h2 class=\"visually-hidden\" id=\"newsletter-promo-heading\">Newsletter Sign Up</h2>\\n    <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#continues-post-newsletter\">Continue reading the main story</a>\\n        <h3 class=\"headline\">Sign Up for the Magazine Newsletter</h3>    <p class=\"summary\">Get the best of the Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.</p>    <form name=\"regilite\" class=\"newsletter-form\" method=\"post\" autocomplete=\"off\">\\n        <div class=\"control input-control\">\\n            <div class=\"form-errors\">\\n                <p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you\\'re not a robot by clicking the box.</p>\\n                <p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

Using this data, I was able to speak to a wide array of the activists and entrepreneurs, advocates and opportunists, reporters and hobbyists who together make up 2016’s most disruptive, and least understood, force in media.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"970\" data-total-count=\"4806\">Individually, these pages have meaningful audiences, but cumulatively, their audience is gigantic: tens of millions of people. On Facebook, they rival the reach of their better-funded counterparts in the political media, whether corporate giants like CNN or The New York Times, or openly ideological web operations like Breitbart or Mic. And unlike traditional media organizations, which have spent years trying to figure out how to lure readers out of the Facebook ecosystem and onto their sites, these new publishers are happy to live inside the world that Facebook has created. Their pages are accommodated but not actively courted by the company and are not a major part of its public messaging about media. But they are, perhaps, the purest expression of Facebook’s design and of the incentives coded into its algorithm — a system that has already reshaped the web and has now inherited, for better or for worse, a great deal of America’s political discourse.</p><div id=\"story-ad-1\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\\n</div>\\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-3\">Continue reading the main story</a>\\n</div>\\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"639\" data-total-count=\"5445\" id=\"story-continues-3\"><strong>In 2006,</strong> when Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of college to run his rapidly expanding start-up, Mark Provost was a student at Rogers State University in Claremore, Okla., and going through a rough patch. He had transferred restlessly between schools, and he was taking his time to graduate; a stock-picking hobby that grew into a promising source of income had fallen apart. His outlook was further darkened by the financial crisis and by the years of personal unemployment that followed. When the Occupy movement began, he quickly got on board. It was only then, when Facebook was closing in on its billionth user, that he joined the network.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"467\" data-total-count=\"5912\">Now 36, Provost helps run US Uncut, a left-leaning Facebook page and website with more than 1.5 million followers, about as many as MSNBC has, from his apartment in Philadelphia. (Sample headlines: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/usauncut/posts/1254899871211158\">“Bernie Delegates Want You to See This DNC Scheme to Silence Them”</a> and “This Sanders Delegate Unleashing on Hillary Clinton Is Going Absolutely Viral.”) He frequently contributes to another popular page, The Other 98%, which has more than 2.7 million followers.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"494\" data-total-count=\"6406\">Occupy got him on Facebook, but it was the 2012 election that showed him its potential. As he saw it, that election was defined by social media. He mentioned a set of political memes that now feel generationally distant: Clint Eastwood’s empty chair at the 2012 Republican National Convention and Mitt Romney’s debate gaffe about “binders full of women.” He thought it was a bit silly, but he saw in these viral moments a language in which activists like him could spread their message.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"898\" data-total-count=\"7304\">Provost’s page now communicates frequently in memes, images with overlaid text. “May I suggest,” began one, posted in May 2015, when opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership was gaining traction, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/usauncut/photos/a.190167221017767.44131.186219261412563/976953659005782/?type=3&amp;theater\">“the first 535 jobs we ship overseas?”</a> Behind the text was a photo of Congress. Many are more earnest. In an image posted shortly thereafter, a photo of Bernie Sanders was overlaid with a quote: “If Germany, Denmark, Sweden and many more provide tuition-free college,” read the setup, before declaring in larger text, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/usauncut/photos/a.190167221017767.44131.186219261412563/979689148732233/?type=3&amp;theater\">“we should be doing the same.”</a> It has been shared more than 84,000 times and liked 75,000 more. Not infrequently, this level of zeal can cross into wishful thinking. A post headlined “Did Hillary Clinton Just Admit on LIVE TV That Her Iraq War Vote Was a Bribe?” was shared widely enough to merit <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-iraq-vote-bribe/\">a response from Snopes</a>, which called it “quite a stretch.”</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"814\" data-total-count=\"8118\">This year, political content has become more popular all across the platform: on homegrown Facebook pages, through media companies with a growing Facebook presence and through the sharing habits of users in general. But truly Facebook-native political pages have begun to create and refine a new approach to political news: cherry-picking and reconstituting the most effective tactics and tropes from activism, advocacy and journalism into a potent new mixture. This strange new class of media organization slots seamlessly into the news feed and is especially notable in what it asks, or doesn’t ask, of its readers. The point is not to get them to click on more stories or to engage further with a brand. The point is to get them to share the post that’s right in front of them. Everything else is secondary.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"499\" data-total-count=\"8617\">While web publishers have struggled to figure out how to take advantage of Facebook’s audience, these pages have thrived. Unburdened of any allegiance to old forms of news media and the practice, or performance, of any sort of ideological balance, native Facebook page publishers have a freedom that more traditional publishers don’t: to engage with Facebook purely on its terms. These are professional Facebook users straining to build media companies, in other words, not the other way around.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"605\" data-total-count=\"9222\">From a user’s point of view, every share, like or comment is both an act of speech and an accretive piece of a public identity. Maybe some people want to be identified among their networks as news junkies, news curators or as some sort of objective and well-informed reader. Many more people simply want to share specific beliefs, to tell people what they think or, just as important, what they don’t. A newspaper-style story or a dry, matter-of-fact headline is adequate for this purpose. But even better is a headline, or meme, that skips straight to an ideological conclusion or rebuts an argument.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1176\" data-total-count=\"10398\">Rafael Rivero is an acquaintance of Provost’s who, with his twin brother, Omar, runs a page called Occupy Democrats, which passed three million followers in June. This accelerating growth is attributed by Rivero, and by nearly every left-leaning page operator I spoke with, not just to interest in the election but especially to one campaign in particular: “Bernie Sanders is the Facebook candidate,” Rivero says. The rise of Occupy Democrats essentially mirrored the rise of Sanders’s primary run. On his page, Rivero started quoting text from Sanders’s frequent email blasts, turning them into Facebook-ready memes with a consistent aesthetic: colors that pop, yellow on black. Rivero says that it’s clear what his audience wants. “I’ve probably made 10,000 graphics, and it’s like running 10,000 focus groups,” he said. (Clinton was and is, of course, widely discussed by Facebook users: According to the company, in the last month 40.8 million people “generated interactions” around the candidate. But Rivero says that in the especially engaged, largely oppositional left-wing-page ecosystem, Clinton’s message and cautious brand didn’t carry.)</p><div id=\"story-ad-2\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\\n</div>\\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-4\">Continue reading the main story</a>\\n</div>\\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"442\" data-total-count=\"10840\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Because the Sanders campaign has come to an end, these sites have been left in a peculiar position, having lost their unifying figure as well as their largest source of engagement. Audiences grow quickly on Facebook but can disappear even more quickly; in the case of left-leaning pages, many had accumulated followings not just by speaking to Sanders supporters but also by being intensely critical, and often utterly dismissive, of Clinton.</p>        <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-5\">Continue reading the main story</a>\\n    </div><!-- close story-body -->\\n    <div class=\"supplemental \" id=\"supplemental-2\">\\n    </div><!-- close supplemental -->\\n</div><!-- close story-body-supplemental -->\\n<div class=\"story-interrupter\" id=\"story-continues-5\">\\n    <figure id=\"media-100000004602750\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-jumbo-horizontal media-100000004602750 ratio-tall\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/28/magazine/28facebook2/28mag-28facebook-t_CA1-superJumbo.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\\n    <div class=\"image\">\\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/28/magazine/28facebook2/28mag-28facebook-t_CA1-superJumbo.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/28/magazine/28facebook2/28mag-28facebook-t_CA1-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"\" data-mediaviewer-credit=\"Screenshots from Facebook\"  itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/28/magazine/28facebook2/28mag-28facebook-t_CA1-superJumbo.jpg\"/>\\n            <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"1761\" />\\n            <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"2048\" />\\n    </div>\\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\">\\n                        <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">\\n            <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit</span>\\n            Screenshots from Facebook        </span>\\n            </figcaption>\\n    </figure>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"story-body-supplemental\">\\n    <div class=\"story-body story-body-3\">\\n        <script>\\n\\tif (window.magnum && window.magnum.responsiveImages && window.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage) {\\n\\t\\twindow.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage(\\'100000004602749\\',\\'vertical-full-bleed\\',790,600,2.0663404023926,6.0171919770774,2.5013594344753,5.945558739255,\\'#FFFFFF\\');\\n\\t}\\n</script>\\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"258\" data-total-count=\"11098\" id=\"story-continues-6\">Now that the nomination contest is over, Rivero has turned to making anti-Trump content.

Share if you agree!”</a> More than 40,000 people did.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"100\" data-total-count=\"11198\">“It’s like a meme war,” Rivero says, “and politics is being won and lost on social media.”</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"915\" data-total-count=\"12113\"><strong>In retrospect, Facebook’s </strong>takeover of online media looks rather like a slow-motion coup. Before social media, web publishers could draw an audience one of two ways: through a dedicated readership visiting its home page or through search engines. By 2009, this had started to change. Facebook had more than 300 million users, primarily accessing the service through desktop browsers, and publishers soon learned that a widely shared link could produce substantial traffic. In 2010, Facebook released widgets that publishers could embed on their sites, reminding readers to share, and these tools were widely deployed. By late 2012, when Facebook passed a billion users, referrals from the social network were sending visitors to publishers’ websites at rates sometimes comparable to Google, the web’s previous de facto distribution hub. Publishers took note of what worked on Facebook and adjusted accordingly.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"486\" data-total-count=\"12599\">This was, for most news organizations, a boon. The flood of visitors aligned with two core goals of most media companies: to reach people and to make money. But as Facebook’s growth continued, its influence was intensified by broader trends in internet use, primarily the use of smartphones, on which Facebook became more deeply enmeshed with users’ daily routines. Soon, it became clear that Facebook wasn’t just a source of readership; it was, increasingly, where readers lived.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"583\" data-total-count=\"13182\">Facebook, from a publisher’s perspective, had seized the web’s means of distribution by popular demand. A new reality set in, as a social-media network became an intermediary between publishers and their audiences. For media companies, the ability to reach an audience is fundamentally altered, made greater in some ways and in others more challenging. For a dedicated Facebook user, a vast array of sources, spanning multiple media and industries, is now processed through the same interface and sorting mechanism, alongside updates from friends, family, brands and celebrities.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"779\" data-total-count=\"13961\">From the start, some publishers cautiously regarded Facebook as a resource to be used only to the extent that it supported their existing businesses, wary of giving away more than they might get back. Others embraced it more fully, entering into formal partnerships for revenue sharing and video production, as The New York Times has done. Some new-media start-ups, most notably BuzzFeed, have pursued a comprehensively Facebook-centric production-and-distribution strategy. All have eventually run up against the same reality: A company that can claim nearly every internet-using adult as a user is less a partner than a context — a self-contained marketplace to which you have been granted access but which functions according to rules and incentives that you cannot control.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"575\" data-total-count=\"14536\">The news feed is designed, in Facebook’s public messaging, to “show people the stories most relevant to them” and ranks stories “so that what’s most important to each person shows up highest in their news feeds.” It is a framework built around personal connections and sharing, where value is both expressed and conferred through the concept of engagement. Of course, engagement, in one form or another, is what media businesses have always sought, and provocation has always sold news. But now the incentives are literalized in buttons and written into software.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"883\" data-total-count=\"15419\">Any sufficiently complex system will generate a wide variety of results, some expected, some not; some desired, others less so. On July 31, a Facebook page called Make America Great posted its final story of the day. “No Media Is Telling You About the Muslim Who Attacked Donald Trump, So We Will ...,” read the headline, next to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/makeamericagreattoday/posts/1778543319091148\">a small avatar of a pointing and yelling Trump.</a> The story was accompanied by a photo of Khizr Khan, the father of a slain American soldier. Khan spoke a few days earlier at the Democratic National Convention, delivering a searing speech admonishing Trump for his comments about Muslims. Khan, pocket Constitution in hand, was juxtaposed with the logo of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. “It is a sad day in America,” the caption read, “where we the people must expose the TRUTH because the media is in the tank for 1 Presidential Candidate!”</p><div id=\"story-ad-3\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\\n</div>\\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-7\">Continue reading the main story</a>\\n</div>\\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"801\" data-total-count=\"16220\" id=\"story-continues-7\">Readers who clicked through to the story were led to an external website, called Make America Great Today, where they were presented with a brief write-up blended almost seamlessly into a solid wall of fleshy ads. Khan, the story said — between ads for “(1) Odd Trick to ‘Kill’ Herpes Virus for Good” and “22 Tank Tops That Aren’t Covering Anything” — is an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood and a “promoter of Islamic Shariah law.” His late son, the story suggests, could have been a “Muslim martyr” working as a double agent. A credit link beneath the story led to a similar-looking site called Conservative Post, from which the story’s text was pulled verbatim. Conservative Post had apparently sourced its story from a longer post on a right-wing site called Shoebat.com.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"560\" data-total-count=\"16780\">Within 24 hours, the post was shared more than 3,500 times, collecting a further 3,000 reactions — thumbs-up likes, frowning emoji, angry emoji — as well as 850 comments, many lengthy and virtually all impassioned. A modest success. Each day, according to Facebook’s analytics, posts from the Make America Great page are seen by 600,000 to 1.7 million people. In July, articles posted to the page, which has about 450,000 followers, were shared, commented on or liked more than four million times, edging out, for example, the Facebook page of USA Today.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"629\" data-total-count=\"17409\"><strong>Make America Great,</strong> which inhabits the fuzzy margins of the political Facebook page ecosystem, is owned and operated by a 35-year-old online marketer named Adam Nicoloff. He started the page in August 2015 and runs it from his home outside St. Louis. Previously, Nicoloff provided web services and marketing help for local businesses; before that, he worked in restaurants. Today he has shifted his focus to Facebook pages and websites that he administers himself. Make America Great was his first foray into political pages, and it quickly became the most successful in a portfolio that includes men’s lifestyle and parenting.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"860\" data-total-count=\"18269\">Nicoloff’s business model is not dissimilar from the way most publishers use Facebook: build a big following, post links to articles on an outside website covered in ads and then hope the math works out in your favor. For many, it doesn’t: Content is expensive, traffic is unpredictable and website ads are both cheap and alienating to readers. But as with most of these Facebook-native pages, Nicoloff’s content costs comparatively little, and the sheer level of interest in Trump and in the type of inflammatory populist rhetoric he embraces has helped tip Nicoloff’s system of advertising arbitrage into serious profitability. In July, visitors arriving to Nicoloff’s website produced a little more than $30,000 in revenue. His costs, he said, total around $8,000, partly split between website hosting fees and advertising buys on Facebook itself.</p><figure id=\"28mag-facebook-pullquote1\" class=\"interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small\">\\n    \\n    \\n    <figcaption class=\"interactive-caption\">\\n            </figcaption>\\n\\n        <div class=\"interactive-graphic\">\\n                <script>function getFlexData() { return {\"data\":{\"quote\":\"Such news exists primarily within users’ feeds, its authorship obscured, its provenance unclear, its veracity questionable.

If something seems to be going viral elsewhere, it is copied to their site and promoted with an urgent headline. (The Khan story was posted at the end of the shift, near midnight Eastern time, or just before noon in Manila.) The resulting product is raw and frequently jarring, even by the standards of this campaign. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/makeamericagreattoday/posts/1784379945174152\">“There’s No Way I’ll Send My Kids to Public School to Be Brainwashed by the LGBT Lobby,”</a> read one headline, linking to an essay ripped from Glenn Beck’s The Blaze; “Alert: UN Backs Secret Obama Takeover of Police; Here’s What We Know ...,” read another, copied from a site called The Federalist Papers Project. In the end, Nicoloff takes home what he jokingly described as a “doctor’s salary” — in a good month, more than $20,000.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"548\" data-total-count=\"19945\">Terry Littlepage, an internet marketer based in Las Cruces, N.M., has taken this model even further. He runs a collection of about 50 politically themed Facebook pages with names like The American Patriot and My Favorite Gun, which push visitors to a half-dozen external websites, stocked with content aggregated by a team of freelancers. He estimates that he spends about a thousand dollars a day advertising his pages on Facebook; as a result, they have more than 10 million followers. In a good month, Littlepage’s properties bring in $60,000.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"460\" data-total-count=\"20405\">Nicoloff and Littlepage say that Trump has been good for business, but each admits to some discomfort. Nicoloff, a conservative, says that there were other candidates he preferred during the Republican primaries but that he had come around to the nominee. Littlepage is also a recent convert. During the primaries, he was a Cruz supporter, and he even tried making some left-wing pages on Facebook but discovered that they just didn’t make him as much money.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"574\" data-total-count=\"20979\">In their angry, cascading comment threads, Make America Great’s followers express no such ambivalence. Nearly every page operator I spoke to was astonished by the tone their commenters took, comparing them to things like torch-wielding mobs and sharks in a feeding frenzy. No doubt because of the page’s name, some Trump supporters even mistake Nicoloff’s page for an official organ of the campaign. Nicoloff says that he receives dozens of messages a day from Trump supporters, expecting or hoping to reach the man himself. Many, he says, are simply asking for money.</p><div id=\"story-ad-4\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\\n</div>\\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-8\">Continue reading the main story</a>\\n</div>\\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1241\" data-total-count=\"22220\" id=\"story-continues-8\"><strong>Many of these </strong>political news pages will likely find their cachet begin to evaporate after Nov. 8. But one company, the Liberty Alliance, may have found a way to create something sustainable and even potentially transformational, almost entirely within the ecosystem of Facebook. The Georgia-based firm was founded by Brandon Vallorani, formerly of Answers in Genesis, the organization that opened a museum in Kentucky promoting a literal biblical creation narrative. Today the Liberty Alliance has around 100 sites in its network, and about 150 Facebook pages, according to Onan Coca, the company’s 36-year-old editor in chief. He estimates their cumulative follower count to be at least 50 million. Among the company’s partners are the former congressman Allen West, the 2008 election personality Joe the Plumber, the conservative actor Kirk Cameron and the former “Saturday Night Live” cast member Victoria Jackson. Then there are Liberty’s countless news-oriented pages, which together have become an almost ubiquitous presence on right-leaning political Facebook in the last few years. Their names are instructive and evocative: Eagle Rising; Fighting for Trump; Patriot Tribune; Revive America; US Herald; The Last Resistance.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"551\" data-total-count=\"22771\">A dozen or so of the sites are published in-house, but posts from the company’s small team of writers are free to be shared among the entire network. The deal for a would-be Liberty Alliance member is this: You bring the name and the audience, and the company will build you a prefab site, furnish it with ads, help you fill it with content and keep a cut of the revenue. Coca told me the company brought in $12 million in revenue last year. (The company declined to share documentation further corroborating his claims about followers and revenue.)</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"780\" data-total-count=\"23551\">Because the pages are run independently, the editorial product is varied. But it is almost universally tuned to the cadences and styles that seem to work best on partisan Facebook. It also tracks closely to conservative Facebook media’s big narratives, which, in turn, track with the Trump campaign’s messaging: Hillary Clinton is a crook and possibly mentally unfit; ISIS is winning; Black Lives Matter is the real racist movement; Donald Trump alone can save us; the system — all of it — is rigged. Whether the Liberty Alliance succeeds or fails will depend, at least in part, on Facebook’s algorithm. Systemic changes to the ecosystem arrive through algorithmic adjustments, and the company recently adjusted the news feed to “further reduce clickbait headlines.”</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"753\" data-total-count=\"24304\">For now, the network hums along, mostly beneath the surface. A post from a Liberty Alliance page might find its way in front of a left-leaning user who might disagree with it or find it offensive, and who might choose to engage with the friend who posted it directly. But otherwise, such news exists primarily within the feeds of the already converted, its authorship obscured, its provenance unclear, its veracity questionable. It’s an environment that’s at best indifferent and at worst hostile to traditional media brands; but for this new breed of page operator, it’s mostly upside. In front of largely hidden and utterly sympathetic audiences, incredible narratives can take shape, before emerging, mostly formed, into the national discourse.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"817\" data-total-count=\"25121\">Consider the trajectory of a post from August, from a Facebook page called Patriotic Folks, the headline of which read, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/patrioticfolks/posts/844065465730567\">“Spread This: Media Rigging the Polls, Hiding New Evidence Proving Trump Is Winning.”</a> The article cited a litany of social-media statistics highlighting Trump’s superior engagement numbers, among them Trump’s Facebook following, which is nearly twice as large as Clinton’s. “Don’t listen to the lying media — the only legitimate attack they have left is Trump’s poll numbers,” it said. “Social media proves the GOP nominee has strong foundation and a firm backing.” The story spread across this right-wing Facebook ecosystem, eventually finding its way to Breitbart and finally to Sean Hannity’s “Morning Minute,” where he read through the statistics to his audience.</p><button class=\"button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large\" data-skip-to-para-id=\"\">\\n</button>\\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"599\" data-total-count=\"25720\">Before Hannity signed off, he posed a question: “So, does that mean anything?” It’s a version of the question that everyone wants to answer about Facebook and politics, which is whether the site’s churning political warfare is actually changing minds — or, for that matter, beginning to change the political discourse as a whole. How much of what happens on the platform is a reflection of a political mood and widely held beliefs, simply captured in a new medium, and how much of it might be created, or intensified, by the environment it provides? What is Facebook doing to our politics?</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"755\" data-total-count=\"26475\">Appropriately, the answer to this question can be chosen and shared on Facebook in whichever way you prefer. You might share this story from The New York Times Magazine, wondering aloud to your friends whether our democracy has been fundamentally altered by this publishing-and-advertising platform of unprecedented scale. Or you might just relax and find some memes to share from one of countless pages that will let you air your political id. But for the page operators, the question is irrelevant to the task at hand. Facebook’s primacy is a foregone conclusion, and the question of Facebook’s relationship to political discourse is absurd — they’re one and the same. As Rafael Rivero put it to me, “Facebook is where it’s all happening.”<span class=\"tombstone\"><i class=\"icon\"></i></span></p><footer class=\"story-footer story-content\">\\n    <div class=\"story-meta\">\\n                <div class=\"story-notes\"><p>John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.</p></div>\\n        <div class=\"story-info\"><p><i>Sign up for </i><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/magazine\"><i>our newsletter</i></a><i> to get the best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week. </i></p></div>\\n\\n        \\n        <p class=\"story-print-citation\">A version of this article appears in print on August 28, 2016, on Page MM50 of the <span itemprop=\"printEdition\">Sunday Magazine</span> with the headline: Blue State. <span class=\"story-footer-links\">  <span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Today\\'s Paper</a><span class=\"pipe\">|</span></span><span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a></span>\\n</span>\\n</p>\\n\\n    </div><!-- close story-meta -->\\n    </footer>\\n        <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#whats-next\">Continue reading the main story</a>\\n    </div><!-- close story-body -->\\n    <div class=\"supplemental \" id=\"supplemental-3\">\\n    </div><!-- close supplemental -->\\n</div><!-- close story-body-supplemental -->\\n\\n    \\n    <div class=\"reader-satisfaction-survey prompt feedback-prompt story-content hidden\">\\n<a class=\"feedback-link\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLW30xgZodF1qRAg80oWEGuDpW-1HHaL0g42G3SmvB2f4lCw/viewform?entry.8537735=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/magazine/inside-facebooks-totally-insane-unintentionally-gigantic-hyperpartisan-political-media-machine.html\" target=\"_blank\">\\n    <p class=\"feedback-message\">We&#8217;re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>\\n</a>\\n</div>\\n\\n    <div id=\"storage-drawer\" class=\"hidden\">\\n        <div class=\"supplemental-sub-item\" data-attribute-position=\"0\" data-attribute-name=\"CombinedMarginalia\" data-attribute-type=\"Related\" data-attribute-subtype=\"\">\\n    <aside class=\"marginalia related-combined-coverage-marginalia marginalia-item nocontent robots-nocontent\" data-marginalia-type=\"sprinkled\" role=\"complementary\" module=\"Related-CombinedMarginalia\">\\n    <div class=\"nocontent robots-nocontent\">\\n                <header>\\n            <h2 class=\"module-heading\">Related Coverage</h2>\\n        </header>\\n        <ul>\\n                                                <li><article class=\"story theme-summary \">\\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/us/politics/facebook-ads-politics.html\">\\n\\n                    <div class=\"thumb\">\\n                <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/23/us/23FACEBOOKweb1/23FACEBOOKweb1-thumbStandard.jpg\" role=\"presentation\" alt=\"\" />\\n                <div class=\"media-action-overlay\"></div>\\n            </div>\\n        \\n        <div class=\"story-body\">\\n                        <h2 class=\"headline\">\\n                <span class=\"title\">Liberal, Moderate or Conservative?

HTTP basic authentication isn't too common for consumer sites/applications that have the concept of user accounts (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) but is simple to setup quickly and you often encounter it on with individual password protected pages/sites. I'm sure you have seen this before somewhere:\n",
    "\n",
    "![http-basic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QnUZW.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookie based user login is what the majority of services use when you login with a browser (i.e. username and password). Once you sign in to a service like Facebook, the response stores a cookie in your browser to remember that you have logged in (HTTP is stateless). Each subsequent request to the same domain (i.e. any page on `facebook.com`) also sends the cookie that contains the authentication information to remind Facebook's servers that you have already logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many REST APIs however use OAuth (authentication using tokens) which can be thought of a programmatic way to \"login\" _another_ user. Using tokens, a user (or application) only needs to send the login credentials once in the initial authentication and as a response from the server gets a special signed token. This signed token is then sent in future requests to the server (in place of the user credentials).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar concept common used by many APIs is to assign API Keys to each client that needs access to server resources. The client must then pass the API Key along with _every_ request it makes to the API to authenticate. This is because the server is typically relatively stateless and does not maintain a session between subsequent calls from the same client. Most APIs (including Yelp) allow you to pass the API Key via a special HTTP Header: \"Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>\". Check out the [docs](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication) for more information.\n",
    "\n",

Just a poor arrangement of flavors...truly. Like, throw some sharp provolone and mozz on a plate and call it a day. (AHEM. YOU ARE EAT N PARK)Boyfriend entrée was the half chicken. Have you ever seen one of those cute little chickies around Easter time? Sweet little baby chickens? That is the approximate size of the chicken they butchered for this clove (????)-filled \\xa0dish, complete with \"smoked potatoes\", i\\'m sorry, WHAT? I believe it was when he bit into a whole clove that he asked me to make him shells and cheese when we got home.Then I started adding up our approximate bill.... All of that aside, the pizza was, in fact, as ridiculously delicious as it looked/smelled on that brunch day, and the drinks were PERFECTION (the \"almost arnie\" and \"porch pink lemonade\"). Probably some of the best mixed specialty drinks I\\'ve had anywhere. So my point is...it is supremely disappointing that such a cool place (atmosphere A+++) is trying so hard. Just shut up and make a bunch of awesome pizzas. Because they are that--awesome. If you go, get the pizzas and some fun drinks. Don\\'t attempt an entrée.

My only complaint is that their pizza menu is seasonal (with several permanent ones). My favorite Porch pizza is the Butternut Squash topped with chicken. I was sad when it disappeared from the menu. I sometimes come to the Porch just for its cornbread. Served in a cast-iron, the cornbread is incredibly tasty, and it's only $5! I highly recommend it if you're here with a large group for late night and you're not feeling pizza but feel like you should munch on something. This one time I came here for cornbread during late night and while my sever was bringing it to my table, he dropped it. I ended up having to wait longer, but he gave a fresh one free of charge. Now that is good service. The Porch is also great for brunch. I recommend the quiche or their seasonal waffles. Overall, I love the Porch.

The all star of the night.Veggie Burger was a miss. The burger itself was fantastic (edamame, black beans, corn, curry powder, etc) salted and peppered. Topped with arugula and brown olives and shaved fennel. The olives were certainly a unique addition, not for all eaters. The bun wasn\\'t vegan, but the farm bread was, so i had that as my bun. Overall the burger was okay, the bread was certainly dry though and i had to pick out the olives. They didn\\'t make sense for my palate.Patio Burger was an average burger, nothing to write home about.Last bit of critique: the \"tater tots\" included with the burgers were whole russet potatoes...a bit odd and not fitting the description. Not a bad thing, just different.Overall, an average restaurant. Can absolutely improve in some areas, but seems to be a hot spot in town, and close to Pitt and CM.'}, {'review_id': 'WarQKPtMjaW3ClfMyNpWrQ', 'user_id': 'M6MQQpaI9RHvdsr30-KynA', 'rating': 5.0, 'date': '12/19/2017', 'text': 'Outstanding food, excellent service, and clean.

It is a great place to get a yummy breakfast sandwich before I head over to the library to study all day. The prosciutto, egg, parmesan, and jam sandwich is fab. When I went, they were out of bacon so I have not been able to try their classic bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. Their brunch on the weekends is also delicious. The eggs benedict is perfect and it comes with their crispy potatoes and spicy ketchup. If you come for brunch, you MUST try their cinamon buns. They are warm and gooey and fresh out of the oven. Finally, for dinner I typically get their pizza as they are the most reasonably priced item on the menu and huge. I love the Bianca pizza it's the perfect combination of sweet and savory with the sweet fig jam and arugula. I have also had the bacon and eggs pizza which was pretty good. Their pizzas do change seasonally. In the summer I had the chicken artichoke pizza. Their pizzas are always a good choice as they are fresh.

I can't explain it. It's just so good. It's sweet and delicious. I also recommend the Porch Burger. It really is delicious, and the potatoes that accompany it are just perfect. The ketchup isn't Heinz (relax) but it has this kind of spice to it that makes it just so unique and worth your time to experience.

But I just can't.I work in Oakland and The Porch is usually where we go for work lunch meetings, since it's one of the only sit down restaurants in Oakland.

I'm a vegetarian, and I've sampled their veggie burger, pizzas, and grilled cheese - all are delicious. They also have great lunch specials. They have a nice selection of beers as well.I love the outdoor seating area, especially when the weather is nice. If I am looking to go to a happy hour after work and it's nice outside, I will pick The Porch every time.What holds me back from five stars is the service and the price. I think they are a tad overpriced, especially for what you get in return. But the service every time I have been here has been pretty lackluster. I've never had a great service experience, which is disappointing, given all the other great things about The Porch.I will continue to go because of the quality and location, but I do hope that I will see an improvement in the quality of service provided.\"}, {'review_id': 'XBK-lPZEEousszZwp6TZiA', 'user_id': 'IiGaHGmbPMoC6SmRrMfDKQ', 'rating': 5.0, 'date': '9/10/2017', 'text': \"This is an amazing restaurant located close to Schenley park.

Let's start with what I loved about the place. Cute place, right in the heart of Oakland near the park. The waiter was very friendly and the service was so quick. We were probably in and out within 45 minutes top.Now here's what I don't like, which really isn't much. The only real complaints I have is around the dish in particular that I got. Eggs benedict is one of my absolute favorite breakfast dishes after huevos rancheros so I will say I am a little bit snobby at times when it comes to my eggs benedict. I think the hollandaise sauce was lacking a little something. I couldn't put my finger on it but it was missing something that would have given it a little more flavor. I also wasn't really pleased with the lack of smoked salmon. I honestly felt like I had maybe 3 bites out of the entire thing that had salmon on it. Which I probably wouldn't have minded if I hadn't ordered the most expensive meal off the menu. Most of the other menu items were around $8-10 I would probably say but mine was $14. At the time I thought that was reasonable given it had salmon on it but after I saw how little salmon was on it I felt that was a little unreasonable. One of the things I loved about the dish was the ketchup and potatoes on the side. It wasn't your average Heinz ketchup, they added something to it that gave it great flavor. Tasted almost like a ketchup my family used to get over in Germany. I realize a lot of my negatives aren't a huge deal so I think a 3 star review is still fair. I would still recommend people go check it out and I will probably be back at some point to try something else as well.\"}, {'review_id': 'hlLh9UHyqjbUqZ0InUDY8w', 'user_id': 'HBMAxsiTdnq_XCF_r13LCw', 'rating': 4.0, 'date': '3/25/2017', 'text': \"The Porch is a great spot in the middle of Oakland to do just about anything because of the ample seating inside and out.

Yum....We also ordered smoked wings that came with blue cheese dressing, buffalo and bbq sauces. Make no mistake...these were not your normal run of the mill bottled sauces/dressings. Each one hit the tongue and made us say, \"Wow\". \\xa0The wings were crispy and were so smoky with the perfect amount of salt. \\xa0Really, no other seasoning was needed...they tasted like bacon.

For whatever reason \\xa0it couldn\\'t be clearer that our server had preconceived notions that we were going to be a \"difficult\" table and treated us with passive aggressive disrespect. We were so uncomfortable and made to feel that we were not welcome in the establishment. Finally when I asked to have our checks split after she failed to offer us that simple courtesy before bringing the check to the table, I felt she aggressively snatched it from my hand. I asked to see a manager at that point who did not offer us anything but excuses about why the server was good. Just terrible service from the waitress to the manager.Back to the food. Not worth the money. I had the porch omelette and it was bland and cold.

With a standing Friday lunch with a few other friends, we have all of our favorites and also try new places too.The Porch is a DEFINITE favorite. With gorgeous outdoor seating for spring and summer with an outdoor fireplace for the fall weather, the atmosphere at The Porch is great. On top of that, the food is always en pointe.Having been here SOOO many times and trying to get something different each time (which is easy because their menu is seasonal and rotating), I can speak to a large section of their menu.Pizzas: Great to share with a friend, but they're so delicious you could almost eat a whole one on your own!Burgers: Large and juicy with interesting ingredients to give your palette an interesting punch to the tongue on a normal lunch option.Sides: Choosing between the side salad and the taters is hard because the salad is a great mix of arugula and spring greens with a light dressing that freshens your tastebuds while the taters are perfect fried crispy golden-ness with a spicy/curry ketchup.Entrees: These change all of the time and oh man have I had some great ones! My favorite to this day is the Chile Verde with cilantro sour cream. Holy moley this was SO good! On my last trip there I had the brisket gnocchi. While I'm not a big gnocchi fan, I LOVED the brisket/sauce it came in.Beers: Though it is a bit hard to order because there isn't a list right at the front and you have to go to the side to see the taps (though I think they may now have a list when you walk in the door), they have a well thought out selection of rotating and seasonal beers. It's not one of those annoying places that only has one type (sigh IPAs...), but instead always has a variety of options ranging from anything from stouts, to irish reds, to pilsners, to yes - IPAs, to more. They even had their own beer brewed by B2 from the honey from their bees on the rooftop.I could talk for so much longer about the porch, so I won't because I hope you've gotten the impression now that this is a YES on your stop in schenley plaza.\"}, {'review_id': 'vemXY1xA4pSTUq3BnxgJGg', 'user_id': '7rdBKgkPX_I4KcHY49668Q', 'rating': 3.0, 'date': '11/5/2016', 'text': 'Although the location is great, I was underwhelmed by the lack of flavor in the pizza margherita.'}, {'review_id': 's0Hm4Y6RDsChrSeE5FHP_g', 'user_id': 'sSF5qYXVHlvjspMlnN_1-A', 'rating': 5.0, 'date': '4/10/2016', 'text': \"I've been to the porch dozens of times over the last few years, even twice in one day sometimes, and not one of my experiences has ever disappointed me.

The pancakes are breakfast burger are favorites if you sit down. The nice thing about the porch isn't just the fresh ingredients but the seasonal rotation of foods. They do a good job of providing different things at different times of the year to satisfy every craving. The pizzas in particular vary year round. The piggie pie in the fall and winter is particularly delicious. A year round staple that I highly recommend is the prime rib sandwich but it's almost always worth it to try one of the specials if they sound intriguing to you. My best luck with specials was when I had tacos. The veggie burger is also always fresh and hearty but the potatoes that come with it are amazing. Dessert at the porch is always delicious too, ask about the gelato flavors. The only big complaint I have is the draft selection. I can find some rare drafts there but there's typically not much to choose from. The wine selection pairs well with most of the food but with the pizza id usually like a draft. Mixed drinks are stronger than at most places though which is great.

The way that it is set up, you walk in and order your meal first, take a number, and then sit where you like (for lunch anyway). You also grab your own water- they have pitchers available with water or \"fancy\" water that is enhanced with fresh fruit and herbs. I prefer the fruit enhanced water- delish. I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, my mom ordered the Reuben and we also ordered lemon basil house soda and passion fruit gelato. Yes... They make their own sodas- they feature different creations depending on when they run out, and also by season. The lemon basil house soda sounded odd to me but my mom wanted to try it. Oh my goodness I am so thankful we did- it was AMAZING! The highlight of everything. I couldn\\'t believe how much I loved it. It was packed with flavor and the two flavors complimented each other so well. Mhm! The pizza was amazing too, fresh jalapeños, BBQ sauce, chicken, pineapple..

It's right there if I need it for a big occasion, but it was just as good on a dinner date. They have food, drinks, and happy hour for both drinks and food (I think their pizza is half off M-Fri after 9PM). Two reasons that set this place apart for me are:1. It's great for large groups. There's a lot of space available, as well as a pretty diverse menu so you can satisfy most of your group. 2. It's reliable. When our original brunch choice was closed for a wedding shower, we got a table for 11 at the Porch with no problems. I think their servers are friendly, and the food has been consistently tasty. Usually when I go, I struggle with picking just one option because everything on the menu sounds delicious. I legitimately worry about missing out on my second choice. The last time I went was for brunch, and there was just too much I wanted to eat. One of their specials that weekend was a skillet full of three warm cinnamon buns, drizzled with cream cheese glaze. Perfect for splitting and so homey. I ended up getting their yogurt with granola and stone fruit, and it was light and flavorful. The prices are not cheap, but they're reasonable. This is definitely one of the nicer places in Oakland. I really like that they have daily specials to change up the menu, and maybe I'll get to try some in the future.

I really wish that I could give 0 stars just because today I was just that disgusted. Background, I work in a health care profession and I am going to school for Social Work (this will play into the review).The Porch at Schenley offers a happy hour special that is only for the bar area. Ok, that is fine. You have an entire restaurant but you choose to only allow this special to occur at one area. I approached the manager Tia to talk to her about this issue. I said, \"Hey we have been here for a bit and would like the special but there are no areas by the bar for us to take up and we were seated at a booth. Could the happy hour be extended to us?\" She said she would talk to the GM Mike and when she came back he said no. This is when my Social Worker hat came out and was put on. I asked where in the bar area was the ADA compliant section? Or even a section for those people who could not sit on those types of chairs without medical consequences? Maybe I couldn\\'t sit in those taller chairs with no padding because of something medical.... But really this response thinks about those with disability that are not visible and might not be able to sit on no backed stools, or other issues have no place for them to enjoy happy hour. Is there no place that would accommodate those who might not want their disability known? Tia was wonderful, she thought about that for a second and was like, \"that is a great comment and no, I haven\\'t thought about that, let me ask Mike.\" At this point in the story Mike will be known as something that might get me flagged so just change his name in your mind. Mike said, \"if that is the case I need to know about the disability and we will pull a table into the bar area.\"So Mike, what you are telling me is that you want someone to tell you that they have a disability, or a medical issue, and then in front of a crowded restaurant you will PULL A TABLE OVER TO THE BAR AREA instead of just allowing someone to hold a booth? Really? REALLY??? So basically, lets out those with issues just so we can get that $5 glass of wine? And if anyone has seen the bar area at the Porch there is no way a table could be dragged over and fit there for 4 people. While this was an enlightening experience I did not let it ruin the night. We ate a full meal, including dessert. But I will really think hard about coming here again. I just hope maybe my question for the night will make the managers and general managers think hard about those who might not be able to partake in their bar area.'}, {'review_id': '6J_xgDgmO1awlHQt0VQ2lQ', 'user_id': '-lWzhsaA1fsvza3lFePBVQ', 'rating': 4.0, 'date': '6/11/2016', 'text': \"The Porch is an Oakland staple.

Chances are I'm coming with a group. If I'm getting a happy hour priced drink, I'm more than likely going to spend a little more in food. So while the deal is good, 15 people at the bar is not enough space. I will say at my most recent visit, the service was outstanding.\"}, {'review_id': 'jYymUOwuJPwBqR2Bf1rTYw', 'user_id': 'mLuMLxubQsEYjMvLgTSLLw', 'rating': 5.0, 'date': '5/30/2015', 'text': \"Had an incredible brunch here on a sunny Saturday afternoon! Arrived at Schenley Plaza and got seating immediately - a nice sized four person table that was outside but not in the hot sun. We were given cool glasses of water (no ice) before ordering our meal. Josh - our server - was very friendly and super helpful, assisting us with drink choices and meal suggestions. We ordered a mint lime drink (sort of like a mojito) and a local root beer, both of which were great. We ordered a burger with a veggie patty (we are vegetarian) and a cinnamon roll for our main meal. The interplay between sweet and savory was unbelievable - the burger had a great crunch to it and the house made ketchup was also incredible. The cinnamon rolls were also out of this world - definitely eat them sooner rather than later though, as they get a bit cold after finishing the burger (you get three rolls). They were drenched in cream cheese frosting which was very gourmet. These, combined with the potato fries that are included with the entrees, made for a hearty meal for 2.Pricing was also reasonable, and service was again great. Can't think of anything that needs to be improved. What a wonderful brunch/drinks/dinner location, without all the pretense of a snooty American restaurant!

Brunch was technically over and it wasn't too busy. It didn't stay quiet for long. We were seated at a round table for two people that was in between bigger tables meant for groups. What happened was we felt sandwiched between two bigger groups and didn't like how close we were to everyone else. It definitely got busy for dinner so now I know not to go at that time.Our waitress was prompt to get water. My friend ordered a berry cobbler with coffee and I got the maple pork belly and bianca pizza, which I knew I would get a to-go box for. The waitress clarified with me that I wanted the pork belly to come out before pizza. I got the pizza first and my friend was approached by a waitress holding an apple pie versus the cobbler. There was some mix up, but everything eventually came out. My friend's cobbler was cold in the middle, burnt on the sides, and tasted gelatin-like in the center as if to say it was sitting out for a while. I did taste it and it wasn't good. She sent it back.The bianca pizza was unlike anything I've ever had before. It had fig jam, goat cheese, arugula, and black truffle oil. The way it smelled was amazing so I was excited to take a bite. I was definitely pleased with the combination of flavors. My favorite thing about the pizza was the way it was served on a metal pan with some pepper flakes and cheese just on the side in little piles. I added pepper to my pizza and I loved it even more after that. I think this is now my favorite pizza.Since my pork belly came out after the pizza, I tried it after I had a slice. It had pumpkin polenta, roasted pears, walnuts, and brie. The presentation was appealing. I didn't particularly like how fatty the pork was, but it still carried a great flavor on its own and mixed in with all of the flavors on my plate. Our waitress didn't come back after bringing our plates so my friend had to flag her down for additional coffee and a to-go box for me. While she wasn't rude or anything, I didn't find our waitress to be helpful or attentive. I would still come back to try out other items on any other day but Sunday at 4pm, but I would ask to be seated at a different table.\"}, {'review_id': 'VjUvzPkykx5oY_Tccf-Sww', 'user_id': '0XbmD3DdIJ41aIi62LihHw', 'rating': 4.0, 'date': '7/25/2016', 'text': \"This is a great place to go for dinner and drinks if you aren't trying to leave the Oakland area.

The crust of all their pizzas are always crispy and they give you three little piles of toppings: parmesan cheese, herbs, chili peppers.If you are a carnivore I recommend getting the Piggie Pie.

It's one of the most savory, buttery, delicious corn bread I've ever had. They put real corn in it and it comes out piping hot. The top of it is crispy unlike normal cornbread.

We came here at least once a month, but they have gone downhill recently. Last month, when I came here, I ordered a Coconut Sorbet for dessert and was given these chunks that looked like a cross between chalk and plaster. It was nothing like ice cream or sorbet at all. I was also very disappointed by my visit last night. My wife, Deborah, and I had been planning this date night for nearly a month in advance. We got our babysitter to take care of our seven year old son, and we went to catch a movie before heading over to one of our old favorites, The Porch. We arrived just after 9, which was perfect for their half-off pizza. Everything was nice when we first got in, it wasn't too crowded so we were able to be seated right away. They brought us menus and our water pretty quickly, and I ordered the Bianca and Deb got the classic Margherita pizza. If only they had some half-off Margaritas to go along, ha ha...the pizza came out in a pretty timely manner, a little longer than usual, but it was fine. As I began cutting my pizza, though, I noticed that the cheese was very tough. Before I even finished cutting my first slice, the waiter came over and asked if we wanted just one check or separate checks. I had just gotten the pizza for about a minute, and they already had the nerve to ask about the check? Let me at least take a bite first! Maybe our waiter was new, but he was pretty unprofessional. I told him that we were not ready for the check yet, and he just walked away. Finally, after cutting for a long time, I got my first slice of pizza, and there was cheese oozing everywhere. Their pizza has never been like this before, there was just so much cheese and oil from the cheese. Deb also complained about her Margherita being too cheesy, and she almost never complains about anything.Then, as we were finishing up, our waiter came over and asked Deb if she wanted a box for the rest of her pizza. She said yes, and he left to ask the same thing to other tables. Our waiter came back about five minutes later without a box, but with our checks. Deb and I had planned on getting a dessert to share, but at this point, I was too furious to deal with the waiter so I just paid for the meal. The waiter took about 10 minutes to return the check, and he still had not come out with a box, so we waited another 5+ minutes for that. I don't know if it was because it was late, but I was pretty displeased with the service we received at The Porch.

I\\'ve also had the chance to sample their pizzas and a couple salads, and I haven\\'t had any complaints about those - I actually really enjoyed sampling the interesting ingredient mixes concocted for those menu items.Oh, and of course I have to give a thumbs up on their drinks! Unique cocktails like the Pineapple Sage Margarita make this an excellent place to go for a happy hour, and I absolutely have to give a nod of respect to any place that carries Wigle Whiskey options (yum!). I think that despite the rocky start we had, I\\'ll definitely keep coming back to explore The Porch\\'s menu now - based on my last few meals here, they\\'ve really started to find their stride in terms of meal planning.

I'm always about Chicago-style pizza so coming east is always a bit out of my pizza comfort zone, but this was okay. I was more reminded of California style pizzas with heavy experimentation especially seeing as truffle oil + fig jam on a pizza would get you crucified in Chicago. But to me the star was the cheesecake. It was a vanilla bean cheesecake that I truly didn't expect to be much. Rarely do you find a restaurant with cheesecake that knocks you off your feet but the cheesecake here was the best I've EVER had. It was incredible. My first bite left me stunned and my jaw literally dropped. This lead to my family mocking me but wow was their cheesecake good. I want to come back to Pittsburgh just for this cheesecake alone.

I could barely taste the shrimp or the zucchini toppings, however, the roasted red pepper was actually really tasty!Asparagus Tocino: This one was probably my favorite one. Not too saucy and had the right amount of toppings.

Not bad, but certainly not great. The service was the same. They didn't ignore us, nor did they dote. I had the porch burger, which is topped with pulled pork or beef or something. Because they rely on the saucy meat, there isn't any traditional condiments and I felt it was a little dry. However the flavor was good, and it was cooked as I ordered it, something a lot of places can't do. It is served with 'crispy potatoes'; basically really well done tiny potatoes, which I liked. A lot of the items seem to have superfulous ingredients for the sake of being fancy, and I'm not so into that.My BF had the ravioli appetizer. At least I think it was an app.-it certainly wasn't an entrée portion. The heading is 'this and that'. I mention that because I found the menu strange and disjointed. I know that sounds completely ridiculous but it made it harder for me to order. I didn't want to end up with two meals or three raviolis to eat. Anyway, my BF thinks they were fried, but I think they were baked. They didn't seem to have that oiliness about them. It was ok; like I said, 3.5 stars. Our friend had a huge piece of meat; I think a rib-eye maybe? He just loved it!, although Todd is the nicest person on the planet and doesn't ever have a bad word to say about anything or anyone, so...ya know.

If it wasn\\'t for the food being tasty, I\\'d be giving a 2 star review. My friend and I came here last night (Thursday) around 9:30. It was relatively crowded since they have half price pizza 9-11pm Monday- Thursday. The hostess spent at least 5 minutes looking around, seemingly confused, before she turned to us and said, \"I\\'ll wipe off this table. Give me one minute.\" We opted to sit at the bar instead since there was only one other patron there when we sat down. The bartender greeted us quickly and took our drink orders-Yuengling for him and the Porch pink lemonade (Limoncello, Fresh Squeezed Lemonade, Raspberry) for me. This was where our efficient service ended. She took at least 10 minutes to make my drink, although she did pour his beer quickly. My drink tasted like it had 0 alcohol in it and for $8, I should at least be able to taste a hint of something. I gulped that down quickly while the bartender stood at the other end of the bar engaged in conversation with a fellow employee. We were clearly ready to order (and I clearly had an empty glass in front of me) and after 10 minutes of her ignoring us, we finally were able to, literally, flag her down to order. I also ordered a glass of pinot grigio which she brought a full 10 minutes later. We chose to start with the grilled eggplant appetizer and split the bianca pizza. Someone other than the bartender brought out both the eggplant, the pizza, and silverware, as well as plates. The eggplant was four pieces grilled served with a honey like sauce. It was really tasty, particularly the drizzled sauce on top of it. Shortly after the appetizer, the pizza came out. The bianca, while not as good as Enrico\\'s Fig Jam pizza, was still delicious in its own right. I wish the crust had been cooked through a bit more, it was a tad doughy but the actual flavors of the goat cheese and fig jam were superb! This pie was also the perfect size to share with someone-we weren\\'t overly stuffed, just satisfied. \\xa0Now back to service, not once did the bartender as how everything was tasting, we had to, again, flag her down and pull her away from her deep conversation with her coworker in order to get additional drinks halfway through our meal, and while we didn\\'t have to ask for our check, we did have to ask her to run the credit card, after she walked by it sitting on the bar at least 6 times (yes, we were pretty irritated and counted). As a former server, I was highly disappointed with the service we received last night. I always tip over 20% and I could hardly justify leaving her even 15% because she brought nothing except our drinks and acted like we were bothering her everytime we needed something, and we are very easy to please diners. I think I\\'d still at least give it one more try, only because the food was good, however, I will sit at a table and see if service is any better.

There was some thick bread served on the side for dipping. It was pretty hard and bland. The third item was maple-bacon sweet potato hash.

All that stands across from Hillman Library is a hot dog cart, a Chinese food truck, and a shaved ice vendor. Dateline 2012: I\\'m a warehouse laborer with a girlfriend who works for a mortgage lender. She picks me up on Friday evening, and without a plan in mind, I direct her towards The Porch. I am shocked at how built-up Schenley Drive now is. I am particularly mesmerized at this strange, new, Modernist/Art Deco restaurant we are about to enter, even more so over the fact that it is owned by Eat \\'n Park, that ubiquitous local chain eatery staple we either adore or despise.The Porch\\'s bill of fare is somewhat small, but each item is intriguing enough to make deciding on what to order difficult.Kay wanted the Farm Bread as an appetizer. I volleyed between Pork Belly and Shrimp & Grits before landing on the latter. Kay still wanted the inexpensive Farm Bread, so we ordered both and did not regret doing so. The grits were closer to a buttery polenta, a golden pool of richness that the sublimely sauteed shrimp floated atop of. Kale finished off the plate, and I finished it all off in minutes, rationing chunks of the meaty shrimp, dragging them through the polenta and from there, mouth-ward, savoring the creamy, the juicy, the oceanborne, the elegantly Southern. Onto something straight from the early morning hours: Farm Bread. According to our bubbly, youthful student server whose name I cannot recall, everything is housemade, including the large sheets of white bread, and the honey butter, apple butter, and jam that come with it in small, metallic ramekins. The bread had a chewy, flour-dusted hide as well as plush innards that seemed to nearly evaporate. This is not bread one wolfs down with eggs, however. Instead, you break off pieces from the massive cuts, slather them with each of the three amazing condiments: one sweet, one sweet and lardy, and one tart enough to enliven the dead before slowly partaking. Successfully resisting the allure of the fiery oven which promised choice pizza, or the fact that their burgers are freshly ground on the premises, I went with the Duck Legs. Oily, briny, skin crisping, meat melting, they sat on a bed of two potato galettes, each imbibed with the essence of the humbly mystical parsnip, flanked by a gaggle of flowery chanterelles, and lying in a potent puddle of Sherry reduction. As I ate...slowly, relishing what was before me, I had to keep telling myself \\xa0that the same company responsible for the Superburger was also behind one of the most ornately gourmet entrees I have ever had. And if that didn\\'t suffice, clots of foie gras, something I\\'d never had before until Friday night, were strewn across the entirety of the dish.Their angelic, salty, smooth decadence left me wanting so much more. This wasn\\'t just a dinner; this was a gift to those who love food. Kay\\'s Chicken Roti defeated her. The rotiserrie chicken came with a cube of Hazlenut dressing, fennel sausage, apple chunks, and a demi-glace of roasted shallots. The dressing, called a \"bread pudding,\" was ethereal. The chicken breast I finished for Kay was unbelievably moist and supple. Traditionalists, take heed. This is your dish at Porch. Our duo of desserts were exemplary but hard to finish. My brick-sized Chocolate Bread Pudding had only a hint of chocolate, the better to focus on the heavenly heft of the sweet stuffing itself. A compelling case for the reuse of stale bread had been made and was topped with a colossal scoop of SCRATCH whipped cream that almost had the consistency of gelato. Raisins garnished the plate beautifully and palatably. Kay\\'s Chocolate Apricot torte was also covered in the whipped cream. I had a taste and found its light flavor refreshing, the apricots getting on well with the cocoa. The waitstaff was exceedingly friendly and competent. It is also worth mentioning that with all of the racial discrimination lawsuits against restaurants making the news lately, it was very encouraging to see that The Porch employs a good number of African-American servers. In fact, around half of the waiters and waitresses were black, and everyone we saw appeared to be enthusiastic about working for such a brilliant new restaurant. I hope that The Porch achieves national recognition for their food, environment, and progressive hiring practices.'}, {'review_id': '1AE3wCdGQ_xdWDB5m0aSqg', 'user_id': 'H5d_nFqzwrREE-YduK2ABg', 'rating': 4.0, 'date': '1/5/2012', 'text': \"We went to The Porch recently for Sunday brunch. \\xa0Love the bright and open space. \\xa0We got a table towards in back along the banquet. \\xa0We were greeted right away by our super perky server.

The bar area in the middle is often open on a nice day for an delightful breeze.The atmosphere... Come as you are. It\\'s at the park, but it\\'s grown-up food in downtown Oakland. Some people have just come in from sunbathing or exercising; others are meeting friends after work or on a date. It can get very loud so definitely it\\'s not a great place to have an intimate conversation or an important meeting. We find it perfect for our family because it\\'s loud enough that we don\\'t have to keep telling our 4-year-old to be quiet (she is expected to sit in her chair--it\\'s not completely a family restaurant), but we can eat good food in an adult restaurant. Also, it\\'s walking distance for all of our friends who work at the universities.First of all, everything at Porch is made in house--including their own Lemoncello--and we love that!I explained that one way to experience a great meal at Porch is to split a pizza (they\\'re big!) and a salad with a pal. Many took my advice.First course: one person had the soup of the day. Vegetable beef. Unremarkable. Salads. Everyone was pleased with the fresh vegetables and quality ingredients. The Summer Bean & Shrimp was a stand-out and is considerably heartier than the others.If you like cornbread, they make a delicious version called Farmbread in an individual-sized cast iron skillet. It\\'s a bit sweet which was a slight disappointment to those who believe cornbread should be savory. However, everyone thought it was an excellent addition to the meal and loved the sweetened butter that accompanied it. My personal favorite item here is the crispy taters. \"Tuscan-style\" (whatever that is?) fried baby white potatoes with a thai ketchup. Love them. Can eat the entire very generous portion myself but shared. Everyone loved them and their special ketchup--except my 4-year old who demands plain ketchup, but she\\'s 4, and ketchup is one of her top 10 favorite foods.The pizzas here my favorite in the city...well, perhaps tied with Mercurios... Before I knew that gluten was responsible for my rashes, migraines, and tiredness, I would feast on these delicious creations for lunches and dinners. My fellow diners enjoyed the BBQ chicken (with the Jalapenos on the side) and zucco arrositito (\"veggie white\"). The crust is thin, but not too thing and crispy and the mozzarella is shaved fresh. My daughter loves the kid\\'s cheese pizza, and it\\'s large enough for two children to share.As the gluten-free rep, I currently order the half-chicken. It was cooked to perfection and served over peppers and fingerling potatoes. Delicious. I don\\'t eat red meat so instead of the chorizo sauce, I\\'ve had them substitute with the red wine and the pesto--both are great. (On a separate trip, my husband raved about the prime rib.)For dessert, we split the s\\'mores, chocolate-peanut better cheesecake, and homeade cinnamon donuts with fruit compote. I cannot say enough about all three of them. They were literally devoured by our party. We couldn\\'t even select a favorite! Get them all!The service is nearly always good with helpful staff. There can be a long wait for things at times, and I\\'m sometimes a bit annoyed when food is not well-timed, e.g., one of the pizzas was delivered a good 10 minutes after the rest of the food. If there is a problem or a special request, I\\'ve found the management to excellent. One manager zoomed our food through the kitchen so that we could get to the library for a children\\'s program on time.Other goodies:They have a super cool \"walk-up window\". It opens at 7am for breakfast sandwiches, pastries, and coffee. The restaurant itself doesn\\'t open until 11am. In the summer they also serve boxed picnic lunches.They take Plaid Cash and Panther Funds and Credit Cards.They have a wide selection of beer, wine, and delish cocktails, but they will also do BYOB for $15.By the by:In case you recognized the letters on the door, they\\'re actually owned by the Eat and Park group as are Six Penn Kitchen and Hello Bisto. Don\\'t let this fact stop you. Other than the fact that all these restaurants are committed to sustainability, locally sourced produce, and customer service, they\\'re nothing alike.'}, {'review_id': 'XpX9zOPbByVYy6HZta4ZUw', 'user_id': 'lLZxjm_7eDxUCDNVaE1fcA', 'rating': 3.0, 'date': '11/3/2015', 'text': \"I've been to The Porch a handful of times--twice for dinner and once for brunch. I have never left totally disgusted, but I don't think it's very good and would like to give it 2.5 stars (come on Yelp, break out the half stars already!). The decor is very open, trendy, bright and inviting and the food presentation is above average. The actual taste is average and I feel that the prices are higher than they should be for what they're offering. Maybe I've just had bad luck, but everything I've had to eat there is either extremely bland or over-seasoned to the point that I can't even eat it (I'm talking about you, brunch potatoes). Service is generally friendly, but clueless. For example, I sat down in a soaking wet booth on my most recent visit and mentioned it to the hostess who was seating us and she just stared at me and looked alarmed while I wiped it up with my napkin. I also had to remind my server to ask me how I wanted my burger cooked and was told that I was getting strips of bacon but had pork belly delivered to the table. He kept a smile plastered on his face, but doing everyone's job when I'm a patron can get exhausting! My aunt loves the pizza at the Porch, but my boyfriend and I didn't like it at all. I get the impression that you either love The Porch and rave about it or don't like it. I'm in the latter group.

When friends come to visit my family we will be taking them to The Porch. Even though The Porch provides a relaxed casual environment just like many others, what sets this place apart from the rest is the aesthetics and location. I\\'ll get to these in a moment.First the service is cheerful, happy and a delight. Exactly what you might expect being located near two major universities. However, the wait staff are not typical \"I don\\'t care nor do I want to try\" college age kids who are just working for spending money. They are professional and patient. The food was excellent. I was told by many to get their homemade pizza but I couldn\\'t resist the lamb special. I would not expect a place like this to serve lamb let alone a lamb dish this great), but this goes to show the range The Porch has. Fortunately others in my group order the pizza and I got to try. It was a perfectly dry crust (not greasy) and a delicious artistic pizza. You cannot go wrong with any of them. The beverages have a great range of wines, beers and spirits. Whats especially great is their use of local breweries. Utilizing local products is always a big plus in my book. Now for location and aesthetics. The location is excellent. Right near Pitt and CMU and the Natural History Museum. The landscape is beautiful, and as a parent of an almost 3 year old boy, having the huge groomed field away from the streets was a blessing. With nice weather you can safely let your kids run around within eye sight. So parents, bring your kids run around and tire them out before dinner. The decor was great. Very warm and inviting and fitting to the culture of The Porch. I love seeing the Edison light bulbs in use. Big open doors and windows and a fire place outside that I cannot wait to use this winter.

Again, surprised by it, an the pizzas a a hit.Touch: 4 - it is a restaurant so this is never a high score unless you eat exclusively with your hands, but as said before the pizza in perfectly dry, no oily/greasy crusts to battle.Smell: 7 - with good food comes good smells.'}, {'review_id': 'mDB6oNs8zlYV6nqc_WUo9A', 'user_id': 'Lfv4hefW1VbvaC2gatTFWA', 'rating': 4.0, 'date': '12/15/2012', 'text': \"Just a great meal all around! \\xa0Great atmosphere, too.The appetizers were sooo goood!The Tuna special was outstanding! \\xa0One of the best Tuna's I have ever eaten.Fun place for the family before the Pitt BB game.Just love eating at The Porch.\"}, {'review_id': '1_h-Rz0KvjMGLHzUts_IWQ', 'user_id': '2iD_yIdPmwbVdrlcr5loVQ', 'rating': 3.0, 'date': '3/11/2013', 'text': \"I really like the ambiance in the place (exposed filament light bulbs,) great location, garage doors that open up to Schenley Plaza when it's nice... \\xa0However, the food plays second fiddle to the atmosphere in my opinion.Having tried various soups, salads, and sandwiches (which are just OK for the price) I think the way to go here is with the wood-fired pizza that they make in their own oven. \\xa0Pizzas are pretty large although one person could finish it off....this is pretty much my go-to option here now (even for brunch.)\"}, {'review_id': '-CEOGs3GAUdk_bUqmy5XUQ', 'user_id': '6CoMpwA8D2s00RfzpKDuOg', 'rating': 4.0, 'date': '1/3/2012', 'text': \"Went back for a late night dessert and drinks.

It's probably due to space, but I hope this changes. I look forward to a nice gin cocktail on the outside porch on a hot day.Small update: went back for brunch again - had the biscuits and gravy and a seasonal soda.

The old Pittsburgh chain establishment is like that guy you knew in college. We all knew that guy. He would wear nothing but Nittany Lion hoodies and ripped jeans all the time. He would wake up at 11, skip class, eat ramen noodles, nap until 5, order a pizza, and be ready for the party by 10. 90% of the time, this kid was a pleasure to be around. Funny, endearing, yet ultimately harmless. But that other 10% of the time, he would be utterly obnoxious. Having a bit too much drink, hitting on your girl, getting into bro fights, calling your cell phone at 3am because he needs to be bailed out of jail, etc. And when he would act up, it would make you not want to hang out with him (or her) for the next 3 months.Flash forward five years. You're downtown and you run into this guy. He's still got the same personality but he looks...different. He's graduated, has gotten a job, is dressing better. You can tell he's been hitting the gym. And he still likes to party, but in moderation, with Christmas Ales taking the place of Keystone Light and bourbon cocktails taking the place of Vladimir out of a paper bag.

It\\'s always nice to have new options in Oakland. I have been here a few times and sampled the appetizers, pizzas, and several entrees. \\xa0I really enjoy the garden harvest salad, which is topped with mushrooms and goat cheese. Very tasty! When it comes to entrees, I have found that I like trying their daily specials when I can. \\xa0In early summer, The Porch had a delicious baked meatball offering. \\xa0The red snapper is also very good. My fish was perfectly cooked and served with clams and vegetables in a saffron broth. For some reason, I find the pizzas to be a bit bland, even their more creative ones. The \"bianca\" has an interesting pairing of fig and goat cheese, but comes off a bit TOO sweet. \\xa0The pesto-themed \"genovese\" is the opposite, and is much too salty for my taste. The dessert menu changes daily. The chocolate bread pudding was delicious, but the tiramisu wasn\\'t as impressive. There are nice little touches that make The Porch a great place to go. First, I like that they have a self-serve water bar (glass coolers with fresh herbs and citrus). The Porch also has... a porch. I know, you\\'re shocked! The outdoor patio and bar are the perfect place to have a casual drink and meal in the warmer months. There is also a fireplace in case it gets a bit chilly. As far as the bar goes, there is a small but well-chosen selection of seasonal beers on tap as well as a decent wine list. \\xa0A small warning, however. As The Porch attempts to use local ingredients, the only whiskey they have is from Wigle in the Strip. That\\'s all well and good, but Wigle is a bit of an acquired taste, in my opinion. It will not taste the same in mixed drinks as Jack or Johnny. Overall, the Porch is an excellent addition to the Oakland restaurant and bar scene. The bartenders are just wonderful and so is the majority of the menu.

We have never had a problem with the staff; they have always been very friendly and helpful with us.On to the food. I generally get a pizza. They are really really good. It is thin crust, and it approaches a New Haven-style pizza but it is more chewy than crispy. The toppings seem to be high-quality. I like to keep my pizza plain here (just cheese and sauce) although the meat-za is good as well. I\\'ve also had the prime rib. It is pretty good, but you need to be careful, as they tend to overcook it based on what you ask for. I asked for it Medium and it had very little pink.

Luckily I had just grabbed the City Paper's Dining Guide and I realized there are a lot of places in the city I haven't been yet - although it feels like I've been to all of them! We had a place picked out, but because the weather was so beautiful yesterday, we decided to switch gears and find a place where we could sit outside and enjoy the nice evening.I found The Porch at Schenley and it was a perfect spot! I can't believe I hadn't been here yet!! We sat out on 'the porch' and the atmosphere was great - people everywhere - and you were able to people watch in Schenley Plaza. It's such a great laid back place. The food was also amazing. I had an Almost Arnie - which was limoncello, iced tea and mint. It was so good and refreshing - not too heavy. We ordered the rustic bread salad which was deelish - a free iron skillet corn bread that I received a coupon for in my email - and that was amazing, and then I had the Garden Vegetable burger. It was served with a side of potatoes. Everything was above average for sure. I can't wait to go back!

This is a good deal. The rating isn't reflecting on the deal itself, but rather how the restaurant manages to spoil it with an obscure policy about where you have to be in the restaurant in order to take advantage of it. Basically, you need to be standing at the bar. If you're at a table you don't get the happy hour special. This is unfortunate because if you come in with a group of people at that time of day, chances are you want to get yourselves set up in a comfy booth and enjoy the late afternoon over a few drinks and, probably, a tasty pizza. I've been in on a number of occasions and suffered at the hands of this peculiarly particular Porch policy. I have sometimes taken issue with my server and had my issue raised with the manager. One time the manager decided to give happy hour drink prices to my table. Every other time the manager was less cooperative.I'm a stickler for service and expect high standards--even in casual places like The Porch. What bothers me the most is when policies don't make sense. Unfortunately, this is one of those times.Will I be back to The Porch? Of course--I work down the street and this is the best bet for lunch or a casual dinner on the Pitt campus. Do I like this weird happy hour policy? No, but what can one do? Other than sit at the bar, I suppose...\"}, {'review_id': 'Til-UOmev5njHo3Rs33h4w', 'user_id': 'iJp3Wu-pYl7osiYqz1Gv7A', 'rating': 4.0, 'date': '9/9/2012', 'text': \"I try to avoid Oakland whenever possible due to the traffic and the lack of parking, but I biked down to the Porch today for brunch and I am so glad I did! The venue is great with both indoor and outdoor seating. We took advantage of the outdoor space since we won't have many more options to do that before the weather changes. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about all of the dishes, and it seems like they use a lot of local ingredients.The menu is not extensive but there are so many appealing options! I was so torn in my decision I had to have someone else make it for me, and I ended up with quiche of the day, which was made with olive tapenade and feta. DELICIOUS. Not only was the quiche great (and different from any other quiche I've had), but the crispy were fantastic. They are nice and soft with just a little crunch to them, and they were flavored with a hint of rosemary. They are served with curry ketchup, which is different - and not in a bad way. It has a bit of a zing to it and is unlike anything I've tried before. I felt like it was a little early to be eating curry, but I got over that pretty quickly. I didn't try the pizza but it looked and smelled amazing. I also got a whiff of the pork belly from a nearby table, and will need to put that on the list to try as well.Oh! And did I mention the pitchers of mimosas?

Being from Florida I love any opportunity I get to sit outside in shade and eat/drink.Our waitress was attentive and very nice. That is about the last nice thing I have to say about this place.We happened to walk past The Porch on a Sunday Funday in Oakland and decided to try it out. My boyfriend ordered a mimosa. Mimosas are incredibly simple drinks. Pretty sure what they served him was a glass of just orange juice, though the waitress insisted it was a mimosa. They also served it in a regular glass instead of a champagne flute. Why bother to offer it?We ordered a margherita pizza to split. It was brought out on a baking pan with piles of red pepper flakes and extra cheese on the side (not in separate containers), which is ridiculously gross. If I was splitting this with friends I wouldn't want everyone dipping their fingers into it. We didn't have spoons so we figured that is what we were supposed to do, though we stopped the waitress and got spoons because that's just gross.The pizza was probably the second worst margherita pizza I've had in Pittsburgh (Fuel & Fuddle gave me the worst). In fact, to call it a margherita pizza would be an insult to actual margherita pizza. It was more like a cheese pizza - where was the basil? Then I found out it's owned and operated by Eat N' Park. That explains everything.I also agree that the pricing seems wack for the neighborhood that it is in. We definitely will not be back.

If you're on a work lunch, expect an ok turn around on getting the food on your table, but I'm not sure you can do it if you are on a 30 minute break. I recall it takes at least 45 minutes from order to finishing your meal.The Porch has a really comfortable, modern space that is welcoming. Wide windows let bright light into the expansive dining room. It's a detail so small, but I love the cloth napkins that they use that look like a smaller version of a kitchen tea towel. You'll order at a counter when you come in and seat yourself, but don't fret: there are servers/busers that peruse the dining area to bring out your food, refill waters, and attend to anything else you might need.

I got a hamburger (somewhat against my better judgement due to all the great stuff on the menu) and asked for medium-rare. What I got was almost revoltingly rare. It had a delicious crust to it so I know it saw some time on the grill, but the center was almost cold (and by the time I finished it was decidedly cold). I like some red to my meat, but there were parts of it that were absurdly raw and not at all pleasant. I've had problems getting medium-rare in Pittsburgh (including Brgr and Burgatory who seem to only do well-done) but this chef seems to under-cook. I pointed it out to my waitress (although I did not send it back because it was really really delicious) and she said they had received similar complaints before. In fact, they guy behind me was complaining to his wife that his came out medium instead of well-done.I'm sure they use good beef and have high safety standards but I genuinely felt like I might get sick from the burger when I was eating it (this did not happen). To drive the point home: IT IS LIKELY THEY WILL UNDER-COOK YOUR BURGER. I don't want to come off as libelous, but from my experience, the guy next to me, and the waitress, this is something that happens with some regularity.That said, the burger was outstanding. The toppings were delicious, the bun was grilled for crust, the salad on the side was a great, slightly bitter accompaniment that was perfectly dressed, and their mixed pickle was sooo good. It was a very well-balanced meal; each flavor complemented each other well and each element was well-made. Maybe I'm being harsh with the 3 stars (especially since I could've taken it back), but when you charge the prices they do, a diner should not have to worry about something so amateur as under-cooked meat.

The food was good enough although limited (as many other reviewers have pointed out), and the drinks are excellent and they have a variety of beers available. This place has gone downhill since it first opened, however -- particularly the service. I have only had one server in this place do even a halfway decent job, and I think he was actually a dishwasher or cook filling in for a server during a desolate lunch shift. Every other time, the server takes upwards of 20 minutes to bring drinks, it's like pulling teeth to get a pitcher of water delivered to the table, and forget about asking for refills or silverware or condiments -- they'll stop by the table and only take one person's request, then disappear for another 20 minutes, after which you'll need to remind them of your request. The most disappointing thing happened just yesterday, when one server who was working a dinner/happy hour service announced that she was sick with the flu that's been going around as she delivered my colleague's salad to the table. I feel bad for the woman for being sick and working through it, of course, but perhaps management should allow their sick employees to take nights off so they don't feel the need to announce their misery to their customers. In short, the service in this place is so bad that the food doesn't even make it worth going.

I asked for water with a lemon and got a small glass of water with no ice and a bowl of lemons. Ok... so then I ordered a lemonade, which was *awful* - it tasted like fake lemon juice dumped into some water with no sugar. Even dumping a pack of Splenda into it did absolutely nothing. Finally I just asked for a glass of ice and pored my tepid water over that.The meal got better when we ordered. I asked if it was possible, since they had a smaller size on the kids' menu, that I get a regular pepperoni pizza. So they adjusted the Margarita pizza to have pepperoni on it and went light on the sauce for me without any trouble.

My best friend had the biscuits and gravy and was so complimentary on how spicy the gravy was and how it somthered the biscuits just right. My wife ordered the burger with egg on it and her medium burger was SPOT ON. Most Pittsburgh restaurants think medium is this pinkish grey color. This was a textbook medium - hot and red with the blood just starting to run through it. Exceptional burger. Presentations are great - pork belly served in a cast iron skillet.

I'm writing my review late, so I imagine some things have changed, but seeing that I probably won't be back for a while, I wanted to put my 2 cents in.The layout and atmosphere was beautiful and unique. It's a real shame they opened in the late fall, because The Porch is definitely a place built for the warmer months. It has a lot of large garage-type doors meant to blend the outdoor area with the diners. While it was still gorgeous on the inside, even in the cold, there was clearly something missing when you looked around and noticed that the nuts and bolts will compliment a Summer breeze better than snow.The food was pretty decent. We ordered 2 appetizers, which were wonderful. My meal, the roasted pig sandwich, was good, but a little salty and bland. I'm not knocking them here by the way, because I do understand that it takes time for a restaurant to figure out the flavors and it doesn't always happen within the first week. It isn't until a lot of patrons are able to offer feedback that they begin to refine their dishes.The price is where it gets a little bit tipsy for me. Our meal was $80, which isn't terrible, but it comes off a little more casual than the receipt. But I'm not dumb either, we did get 2 beers each, 2 appetizers and a meal each. The money was well spent, but it was difficult for me to understand exactly what type of restaurant they wanted to be. Classy? Casual? Either way ... go try them out! They are a welcomed addition to the Oakland area.Before I close this ... one pitfall did hit me. My friend ordered a pizza and it came on a huge cookie sheet / pan. While this aesthetically was kinda cute, it took up a ton of space and downgraded the experience slightly. It goes back to my statement about what they were trying to be. Who wants to eat slightly pricey pizza on a pan that takes up most of their table space? Just a thought!\"}, {'review_id': 'cMaQ2Q3srOXM7Wd3abTBPg', 'user_id': 'zC3Vot_HRlPfPhX7wUz6MA', 'rating': 4.0, 'date': '4/17/2013', 'text': \"We went to The Porch this past Saturday and the food was delicious. My wife had never been to The Porch before so the waitress was explaining that the food was mainly organic or natural food with the exception to their water. She said the water is not organic but it is locally sourced and 100% guaranteed to contain water molecules previously drank by Julius Caesar. Which sounds awesome; unless you grew up in the British education system. Which is why my wife asked me if Julius Caesar was a famous US President.We started off with the cast iron cornbread and scallops. Both tasted good. We especially liked the honey butter with the cornbread. The scallops came with risotto and some type of nut in a spicy red sauce. I couldn't quite determine what was in the red sauce, but it tasted so good.For the entrees, we had the Filet Mignon and Salmon. The filet was wrapped in bacon and perfectly cooked. I personally don't like broccoli rabe. I don't know why people like broccoli rabe so much. I always feel like I am getting cheated out of the good broccoli parts. I also didn't like the Violet Mustard sauce under the filet that much. I would really like to try a blue cheese sauce with some sort of alcohol in it. The salmon and all of the side dishes were delicious. The skin on the salmon was nice and crispy. I have never been able to get the salmon skin this crispy at home and don't know how hard it is for a trained chef, but most places don't nail this dish the way The Porch nailed this dish. This dish was put together and cooked so well, that there is nothing to improve on with this dish. If you like salmon, this is a wondrous dish. We will definitely be back soon.\"}, {'review_id': 'M0QFUY44kVQXjS3A-vIRHg', 'user_id': 'MQuSwlnHULKbR421AZ-cjQ', 'rating': 2.0, 'date': '4/21/2014', 'text': \"I really wanted to love this place but I didn't. The food was just ok and under-seasoned for my tastes. I went with some friends for brunch and everything sounded really good. They had daily specials that all sounded really good. I ended up getting the crab scramble. It was basically scrambled eggs, asparagus, and crab meat. The eggs were still runny when I got the dish which I was ok with but it seemed like something that I could have done on my own. It did come with potatoes which were also pretty tasty but they had fennel in them this day. Fennel is kind of an odd spice for me. It was not my favorite with the potatoes.After going for brunch, I was intrigued by the Bianca pizza with goat cheese, fig jam, and arugula. A friend had gotten me onto having arugula on pizza and I wanted to try this one. It was just alright. I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese but It didn't have enough goat cheese or fig jam to pair well with the arugula. Aside from the arugula, the pizza was too mild for me. I had made my own pizza with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and prosciutto that came out way better than this pizza at The Porch.

Be warned, they don\\'t seem to have full service at lunch; you order at the counter and they give you you\\'re drink and bring you your food, but that\\'s it. You have to get your own refills and go back up to get more food. \\xa0So for lunch, I\\'m not feeling the love, especially if you\\'re on a college budget.I went there last night for dinner, though, and The Porch redeemed itself. I met my mum and we started with the cheese plate appetizer. It comes with provolone, goat cheese, fresh mozzarella, blue cheese, drops of olive oil and honey, nuts, apple and pear slices, and bread of course. That was delicious. I had a generous Caesar salad, which was also pretty good. Then for our main course, we both had the ribeye with \"crispy taters.\" The steak was big and juicy, and although I was skeptical at first, the curry ketchup was excellent. The potatoes were whole little potatoes that were fried I guess, and they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They were playing a good bit of classic rock, so we both really liked the atmosphere. Our waitress was excellent. uThe downside; it was $75 for the two of us, without including the tip. It is a fancier place, though, so we expected it. I always like to see new places open, so if you\\'re looking for an upscale dinner in Oakland, give this place a try.'}, {'review_id': 'Z1aX_a7eWOMtmEbm0wve3g', 'user_id': '-HFS0AEGdcrO-a2JQRrhHA', 'rating': 1.0, 'date': '10/7/2013', 'text': 'I have never written a review for a restaurant on Yelp before, but The Porch has disappointed me so many times, that I just had to post one.In my opinion, the worst thing about the Porch is their service. \\xa0Their bartender, in addition to being rude and inappropriate toward females, cannot seem to handle more than 6 people at the bar.

But I'm definitely glad that this place popped up in Oakland rather than the traditional Eat'n Park that was rumored to be planned for the location. I'm also thankful that the building is well-designed and doesn't look like an ugly eyesore in the middle of Schenley Plaza. So while I wish that the space had been left empty and full of nice green grass, it is what it is and at least The Porch has some pretty decent food to show for it.It is an odd location. I don't think the average broke college student is going to be too excited about $8 margaritas and $20 duck drumsticks. Questionable business plans aside, I really enjoyed my dinner here. The calamari with zucchini straws was perfect! Tentacles included (my fav, I'll fight for those!) so you know it's the good stuff, and it came with lots of lemon wedges and a homemade marinara sauce. It's like they read my mind! I also was in love with the pork belly with pumpkin and fennel...so autumnal! The dish was pretty greasy but hey, it's a chunk of pure animal fat, so what's a little bit of extra grease, really? Other than that it was ridic tasty. The homemade soda was also fabulous though it would definitely taste better with vodka (why do they only have two cocktails on the menu? and one is tequila-based? bummer).The one part of my meal that fell short was the Rieger Pork Soup. The concept is perfection--french onion soup with pork. Where could that go wrong? Unfortunately, the soup was completely devoid of flavor. Once I dumped half the salt shaker in it, it became edible, but the main problem was that the onions were not caramelized at all. Topped with a bland slice of cheese, it was the only disappointment of my meal.I do have to say, all the raves about the atmosphere are kind of off. I could imagine it being a great lunch spot with all the natural light coming through the windows, but at dinnertime, the lights were WAY too bright. The cheap cafeteria vibe (or should I say, Eat'n Park vibe) was totally offputting and an inappropriate match for the sophisticated food. Otherwise, the space is cute, cozy, and well-utilized.

The manager walked by our table looking for our wine glasses, noticed we did not have any and delivered our wine.By the time our pizza came our water jug was empty. Nick did not ask us how our bread or wine was. He did not ask if we needed anything else. The pizza was as we expected. Small enough for one hungry person to eat, but large enough for 2 people not looking to stuff their faces. Our meal is now over. Nick comes to us with a small jar with our check inside. He asks if there is anything else he can do for the night, we said no and he gave us the check. Our plates are empty and nicely placed by the end of the table to be cleared. I am calculating the tip I want to give him since our food was brought out in a timely manner and was an excellent meal. However, I was not sure how much to tip for the service I received. We decided on a 15% tip and I rounded up to make the total bill a round dollar. While doing this Nick came by and looked over my shoulder. When I was done signing the check my girlfriend was still finishing her wine, and I joked \"Watch him come take the signed check.\" Lo and behold Nick walks by, swiftly grabbing the jar, never clearing the table, and without a \"Good Night\" or \"Thank you\", he was gone....Watching other servers, I know Porch has some good staff.
