    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce the [Valve's Dota 2 API](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI#Dota_2) and several methods to analyze a Dota 2 match and a Dota 2 player.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Dota 2](http://www.dota2.com/play/) is a multiplayer online battle arena ([MOBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena)) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a \"hero\", who all have unique abilities and different styles of play.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Valve, there are more than 1,000,000 active Dota 2 players in the world and a huge amount of matches being played every day. Many Dota 2 professional teams are competing with each other in for huge bonus and honor. For instance, the sixth [Dota 2 TI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_%28Dota_2%29) had an overall prize pool of over $20 million. By analyzing the Dota 2 match data, we could evaluate the performance of each player and find the most valuable player on the winning team and drawbacks of losing teams. In this way, players and professional teams are able to improve their skills efficiently. Moreover, by analyzing the hero preference of players, we could design specific team formation against our opponents."

You can install it using `pip`:\n",
